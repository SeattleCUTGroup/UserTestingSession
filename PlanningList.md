Planning a CUT session can broadly be broken down into three seperate stages: 1: Plan; 2. Execute; and 3. Report. Below are directions for executing each of these stages. There are also a set of [Stage Checklists]() for a more conise list of reminders for 

### Plan 

**Initiate a project**
- A CUT session is initiated when a project sponsor fills out a proposal form.
- The CUT governing board will evaluate the proposal and its feasibility for a CUT session. 
- A CUT board member will volunteer to be the CUT sponsor
- The CUT sponsor will identify a Session Lead
- The CUT sponsor will create a repsoitory from the CUT Session Template on Github, and add the Session Lead to the repository as an "owner" with read / write permissions. 

**Sponsor Coordination**
- The Session Lead will modify the newly created repository to act as a planning space for the upcoming session. 
- The Session Lead will host a meeting with the Project Sponsor to better understand their goals, specific time frame and requirements of the CUT session, etc. 
- The Session Lead should then create a proposed [budget] and submit this to the CUT Sponsor for approval. 
- The Session Lead should identify a Session Designer who will be responsible for creating tasks, activities, interview questions, etc. based on the goals or requirements of the sponsor. 


**Session Design**
- The Session Desiginer will create a draft of the session, the intended outcome of each activity, and the plan for data collection based on the notes from the Session Lead and Project Sponsor. 
- The Session Lead will verify the tests and discuss the intended plan of the CUT session with the Project Sponsor. At this point the ideal sample of testers should be discussed with the sponsor. See the ['How to Sample']() documentation for more information on the CUT groups approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion in user testing.   
- The Session Lead and Session Designer will recruit Session Facilitators
- The Session Lead will identify dates, times, and locations for CUT sessions. Locations should roughly aim to map on to [City of Seattle Neighborhood Districts](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhoods-and-districts). 
- The Session Lead will reate an informed consent release from the (CUT template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jkPhyV05B48YvOeNmngopp_haQp3tDO/edit#). The sections that need to be modified are highlighted in yellow. 
- The Session Lead should verify with the CUT Sponsor the plan for compensation, any materials that need to be purchased, and secure any gift cards to be used for participant compensation.
