This is a template repository for designing a Seattle CUT session. If you mofidy this template please record your changes in the [template log](https://github.com/SeattleCUTGroup/UserTestingSession/blob/master/template_log.md) document.  

When initiating a new project for a CUT session follow these steps:  

1. A member of the CUT board will start a new repository for you under the [SeattleCUTGroup]() organization. 
2. In the new repository modify this `readme.md` with a description of the sponsor, roles, and dates of the CUT session. For an example see the [CityClerk](https://github.com/SeattleCUTGroup/CityClerk) repo 
3. Under the settings tab above you can invite new people to the repository. 
4. Follow the [Session Design](https://github.com/SeattleCUTGroup/UserTestingSession/blob/master/PlanningList.md) document for guidance to execute the session. 
5. Have fun! And, thank you for working with Seattle's CUT group.
